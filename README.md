# Pimcore Poll Plugin #

## Introduction ##

Need to publish poll on your pimcore powered website? I think you just found a ready-made solution :)

## Installation ##

Just like other Pimcore plugins:

*   clone plugin files into `/plugin/Poll` directory

*   navigate to `Extras -> Extensions -> Manage Extensions` in admin panel

*   enable & install plugin

*   reload admin interface

If everything went smoothly you will find `Poll` options in `Extras` menu.
